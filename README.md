## Speech to text with audio file attachments

**Preparation**
- setup deepspeech according to [the docs](https://deepspeech.readthedocs.io/en/latest// "the docs")
- install sxhkd and figure out how to autostart it (wm/de dependent)
- install a notification daemon (optional but reccomended)

**Installation**
- git clone the repo
- chmod +x the scripts
- add binds to the sxhkdrc, more info [here](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd "here")

**Thanks to**
- Mozilla (for deepspeech)
- baskerville (for sxhkd)
- Entrix (for helping me and writing scripts when I was unable to)
- everyone else for the emotional support
